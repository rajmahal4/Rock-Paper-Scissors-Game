For this project we created a mini console rock paper scissors game. 

We used global variables for the game function. We used conditionals and we used string methods.

We used split() and used '!' as a separator. split() splits the string into an array. it takes a separator as a parameter. 

I had issues making the playRound() function loop 5 times. I used a for loop that I saw in another project and that made the function loop. 

Also had issues with the game() function parameters. I fixed it by adding the prompt for playerSelection in the for loop. This allowed a prompt every time the loop ended. 

Lastly I dont understand why we used Const for playerSelection and computerSelection. 
Need more time understanding when to use let vs var vs const.
